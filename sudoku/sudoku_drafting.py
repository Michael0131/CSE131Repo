# 1. Name:
#      -Michael Johnson-
# 2. Assignment Name:
#      Lab 05 : Sudoku Draft
# 3. Assignment Description:
#      -This program plays the game of sudoku-
# 4. What was the hardest part? Be as specific as possible.
#      One of the most challenging parts was handling user input validation properly. Ensuring that moves were formatted correctly, 
# numbers were within valid ranges, and the player wasnâ€™t overwriting pre-filled cells required multiple checks. Initially, the program 
# relied on break and continue statements, but I refactored it to use pure conditional logic for cleaner flow.
# 5. How long did it take for you to complete the assignment?
#      -3-
